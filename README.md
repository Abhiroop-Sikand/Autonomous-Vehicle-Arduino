# Autonomous-Vehicle-Arduino
Pathfinder Smart Robot: Obstacle detecting and path following robot with ultrasonic and sound sensors.

Abstract: 

The project utilises the concept of embedded systems to develop a robotic system using Arduino technology for line following and obstacle avoidance. The primary objective project will be using additional sensors to detect and follow a designated line while avoiding obstacles. The model can make real-time decisions and can be implemented at places where humans and robots can work together without confusions in navigation, for instance in warehouses. The anticipated outcome is a functionally capable robot which is able to follow instructions while responding to changes in the environment. 

Roles: 

???: Collect all the hardware components and help in assembling the hardware and work on the software. The main responsibility is to make sure that the mechanical and electrical systems are integrated properly.

???: Get the frame ready and code the program. The focus will be on developing the software which will control the obstacle avoiding robot. Besides that, writing the code to interface with the sensors is the main responsibility.

???: Assemble the hardware on the car chassis and integrate the hardware and software making sure that it works properly. If any issue arises during testing then troubleshooting it is the main focus. 

Individual Contributions: 

My theoretical work involves researching embedded systems and sensor integration techniques. Experimentally, I was responsible for assembling the Arduino platform, integrating ultrasonic and sound sensors, and optimising the robot's navigation algorithms. A particular example of this was when the 2 IR sensors had to be calibrated repeatedly till they were functioning properly, as they were inconsistent with following the paths shown with the black tapes. There were assembly issues where hardware was broken and could not be physically attached properly, unique and creative approaches had to be used to ensure stability and proper attachment. 

What has been learned?

Engaging in this project provided me with valuable hands-on experience in embedded systems development and robotics. I learned practical skills in programming microcontrollers, integrating sensors, and optimising algorithms for real-world applications. Moreover, collaborating with team members enabled me to enhance my communication and teamwork skills, essential for successful project execution.
